# Stock-Price-Prediction-Using-LSTM-and-Time-Series-Analysis-
Developed a machine learning projects to predict stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and time series 
analysis techniques, including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling. 
Utilized Python's TensorFlow library to build and train LSTM models.
